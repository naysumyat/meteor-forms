# Meteor Forms

A smart package for generating bootstrap forms (inspired by [formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic))

## TODO

Mass assignment protection where possible

Auto focus (default) and manual focus

`method` key should allow a string or function with string denoting a `Meteor.method`

Need a reset action, should clear the form and emit a 'reset' event

Cancel should clear the form and emit a 'cancel' event

Use placeholders more often in demo (goes for validation demo too)

Use backbone routing for demo tabs (validation demo too)

Round out inline form demo, username field shouldn't clear, password field should be a password field
