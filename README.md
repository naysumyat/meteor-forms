# Meteor Forms

A smart package for generating bootstrap forms

## Credits

Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic">formtastic</a>

## TODO

Mass assignment protection where possible

`method` key should allow a string or function with string denoting a `Meteor.method`

Need a reset action, should clear the form and emit a 'reset' event

Use placeholders more often in demo (goes for validation demo too)

Round out inline form demo, username field shouldn't clear, password field should be a password field

Round out existing widgets

Add some more widgets

Do more work on focus maybe
